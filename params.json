With this filter added on to a firehose feed, only posts or comments with more than X points will be included.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, here's a feed of [posts with 200+ points](http://hnrss.org/newest?points=200) and [comments with 100+ points](http://hnrss.org/newcomments?points=100).\r\n\r\n#### Caveat: Comments and the points filter\r\n\r\nThere is one thing you should know when using the points filter on comments: It takes five days for point values on comments to be accurately reported via the Algolia API. What this means is there is a five day delay between when a comment is posted and when it shows up in an RSS feed when using the points filter.\r\n\r\nThis is a [known issue](https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/issues/29#issuecomment-41527957). My guess is the volatile nature of comment voting makes it more trouble than its worth to report a comment's realtime points value.\r\n\r\n**Note:** [The comments firehose](http://hnrss.org/newcomments) itself doesn't have this limitation, its only when using the points filter.\r\n\r\n### Activity\r\n\r\nSimilar to the points filter, you can also filter posts based the number of comments it has.\r\n\r\nFor example, here's an RSS feed with [all posts containing 25+ comments](http://hnrss.org/newest?comments=25).\r\n\r\n### Self-posts\r\n\r\nMore and more people are turning to Hacker News to ask questions and show off their projects.\r\n\r\nhnrss provides feeds for [all \"Ask HN\" posts](http://hnrss.org/ask) and [all \"Show HN\" posts](http://hnrss.org/show) along with all [polls](http://hnrss.org/polls) as they appear on the site.\r\n\r\n### Users\r\n\r\nAfter reading Hacker News for awhile, you begin to recognize certain usernames. So if you enjoy patio11's business advice, or tptacek's crypto knowledge, or Matt_Cutts's take on web spam and don't want to miss what they have to say, subscribe to their RSS feed.\r\n\r\n- For an RSS feed with both posts and comments: `/user?id=USERNAME`\r\n- For an RSS feed with just posts: `/submitted?id=USERNAME`\r\n- For an RSS feed with just comments: `/threads?id=USERNAME`\r\n\r\n### Threads\r\n\r\nIf there's some thread you're particularly interested in, you can subscribe to an RSS feed with new comments in that thread at `/item?id=THREAD_ID`\r\n\r\n### Searches\r\n\r\nSay you're a Django developer and want an RSS feed with every post and/or comment mentioning Django.\r\n\r\nTo filter on a search query, pass `?q=SEARCH_TERM` to any of the above feeds.\r\n\r\nSo, for all new posts mentioning Django: `/newest?q=Django`.\r\n\r\nYou can also do the same for new comments via `/newcomments?q=Django`.\r\n\r\n## URL structure\r\n\r\nAll of the feeds try to mirror aspects of the Hacker News website. You'll see this reflected in the URL structure.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nhnrss is powered by [Algolia](https://hn.algolia.com/api), the\r\n[official Hacker News API provider](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7547578).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
