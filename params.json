With this filter added on to a firehose feed, only posts or comments with more than X points will be included.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, here's a feed of [posts with 200+ points](http://hnrss.org/newest?points=200) and [comments with 100+ points](http://hnrss.org/newcomments?points=100).\r\n\r\n#### Caveat: Comments and the points filter\r\n\r\nThere is one thing you should know when using the points filter on comments: It takes five days for point values on comments to be accurately reported via the Algolia API. What this means is there is a five day delay between when a comment is posted and when it shows up in an RSS feed when using the points filter.\r\n\r\nThis is a [known issue](https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/issues/29#issuecomment-41527957). My guess is the volatile nature of comment voting makes it more trouble than its worth to report a comment's realtime points value.\r\n\r\n**Note:** [The comments firehose](http://hnrss.org/newcomments) itself doesn't have this limitation, its only when using the points filter.\r\n\r\n### Activity\r\n\r\nSimilar to the points filter, you can also filter posts based the number of comments it has.\r\n\r\nFor example, here's an RSS feed with [all posts containing 25+ comments](http://hnrss.org/newest?comments=25).\r\n\r\n### Self-posts\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for RSS feeds for [Ask HN](http://hnrss.org/ask), [Show HN](http://hnrss.org/show), or [polls](http://hnrss.org/polls), we've got you covered.\r\n\r\n### Users\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to miss a post or comment by a given user, you can subscribe to that user's RSS feed.\r\n\r\nThe URLs for both posts and comments, just posts, and just comments are (respectively):\r\n\r\n- http://hnrss.org/user?id=USERNAME\r\n- http://hnrss.org/submitted?id=USERNAME\r\n- http://hnrss.org/threads?id=USERNAME\r\n\r\nWith `USERNAME` replaced with the username in question.\r\n\r\nAs a shortcut, when on a user's [profile page](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tptacek) you can replace \"https://news.ycombinator.com/\" with \"http://hnrss.org/\". This also works on a user's [submitted](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=tptacek) and [comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=tptacek) pages.\r\n\r\n### Threads\r\n\r\nIf there's some thread you're particularly interested in, you can subscribe its RSS containing new comments in that thread at http://hnrss.org/item?id=THREAD_ID.\r\n\r\n`THREAD_ID` is the number after `?id=` when viewing a post's comments page ([Example](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7895504)). Or, as a shortcut, replace \"https://news.ycombinator.com/\" with \"http://hnrss.org/\" when on a comments page to get the RSS feed.\r\n\r\n### Searches\r\n\r\nYou can also filter based on search terms via the `?q=SEARCH_TERM` query filter.\r\n\r\nFor example, here's a feed of all [new posts that mention \"Django\"](http://hnrss.org/newest?q=Django) and all [new comments that mention \"git\"](http://hnrss.org/newcomments?q=git).\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nhnrss is powered by [Algolia](https://hn.algolia.com/api), the\r\n[official Hacker News API provider](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7547578).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
