With this filter added on to a firehose feed, only posts with more than N points will be shown.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, here's a feed of [posts with 200+ points](http://hnrss.org/newest?points=200).\r\n\r\n**Note:** The `?points=N` filter doesn't work with `/newcomments`. This is [by design](https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/issues/55#issuecomment-73599729).\r\n\r\n### Activity\r\n\r\nSimilar to the points filter, you can also filter posts based the number of comments it has.\r\n\r\nFor example, here's an RSS feed with [all posts containing 25+ comments](http://hnrss.org/newest?comments=25).\r\n\r\n### Self-posts\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for RSS feeds for [Ask HN](http://hnrss.org/ask), [Show HN](http://hnrss.org/show), or [polls](http://hnrss.org/polls), we've got you covered.\r\n\r\n### Users\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to miss a post or comment by a given user, you can subscribe to that user's RSS feed.\r\n\r\nThe URLs for both posts and comments, just posts, and just comments are (respectively):\r\n\r\n- http://hnrss.org/user?id=USERNAME\r\n- http://hnrss.org/submitted?id=USERNAME\r\n- http://hnrss.org/threads?id=USERNAME\r\n\r\nWith `USERNAME` replaced with the username in question.\r\n\r\nAs a shortcut, when on a user's [profile page](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tptacek) you can replace \"https://news.ycombinator.com\" with \"http://hnrss.org\". This also works on a user's [submitted](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=tptacek) and [comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=tptacek) pages.\r\n\r\n### Threads\r\n\r\nIf there's some thread you're particularly interested in, you can subscribe its RSS containing new comments in that thread at http://hnrss.org/item?id=THREAD_ID.\r\n\r\n`THREAD_ID` is the number after `?id=` when viewing a post's comments page ([Example](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7895504)). Or, as a shortcut, replace \"https://news.ycombinator.com\" with \"http://hnrss.org\" when on a comments page to get the RSS feed.\r\n\r\n### Searches\r\n\r\nYou can also filter based on search terms via the `?q=SEARCH_TERM` query filter.\r\n\r\nFor example, here's a feed of all [new posts that mention \"Django\"](http://hnrss.org/newest?q=Django) and all [new comments that mention \"git\"](http://hnrss.org/newcomments?q=git).\r\n\r\nBy default, searches only look at post titles. This is probably what you'll want 95% of the time, but this behavior can be customized via the `search_attrs` filter. Here's a few examples:\r\n\r\n- http://hnrss.org/newest?q=Wordpress — Search for articles with 'Wordpress' in the post title only.\r\n- http://hnrss.org/newest?q=Wordpress&search_attrs=url — Search for articles with 'Wordpress' in the post URL only.\r\n- http://hnrss.org/newest?q=Wordpress&search_attrs=title,url — Search for articles with 'Wordpress' in the post title or URL.\r\n- http://hnrss.org/newest?q=Wordpress&search_attrs=default — Don't restrict search attributes at all. This searches for articles containing 'Wordpress' in all attributes indexed by Algolia. This was the behavior of searches prior to June 3, 2015.\r\n\r\n### Misc.\r\n\r\nBy default, the RSS `<link>` element points to the submitted article's URL. The `<link>` element can be changed to point to the Hacker News comment page by appending `?link=comments` to the end of the URL. See [here](http://hnrss.org/newest?link=comments) for an example.\r\n\r\nThe RSS `<description>` element contains a link to the comment page when `<link>` points the article (i.e., the default) and a link to the article when `<link>` points to the comment page (e.g., with `?link=comments`). This way you can easily get to either page.\r\n\r\nYou can disable the `<description>` element entirely by passing `?description=0` to a [URL](http://hnrss.org/newest?description=0).\r\n\r\nYou can combine multiple filters with the ampersand character ('&'). For example, here's the URL for all posts with \"git\" in the title and that have more than 25 points: http://hnrss.org/newest?q=git&search_attrs=title&points=25.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nhnrss is powered by [Algolia](https://hn.algolia.com/api), the\r\n[official Hacker News API provider](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7547578).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
